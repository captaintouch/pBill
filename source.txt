SOURCE NOTES:
  pBill is a reasonably direct port of xBill 2.0 which was written in C++.
  Most of the PalmOS specific code is in the pBill.cc file and the rest was
	left mostly intact, with the exeption of UI.cc which was mostly gutted.
	This is my first attempt at a GCC program for the palm so I would
	appreciate if you let my know of any better ways of doing things or problems
	with the code.

COMPILING:
  This game is written in C++ which GCC doesn't seem to like that much.  
  I found it complained about a line containing 

	  enum {false, true}; 

	in 'include/PalmOS/Common.h'.  I changed this to read

	  #ifndef __cplusplus
		  enum {false, true};
		#endif

	and things seemed to work.  You'll also need Perl installed to get the
	image conversion working.

IMAGES:
  The images were taken from the original version and can be found in the
	'fullpics' subdirectory.  They were then shrunken and converted to 2-bit
	greyscale as 16 colour bitmaps using the windows palette.  Any colour other
	than 0,7,8 or 15 are transparent.  These are processed by 'bitmap.pl' which
	converts them into 'pics.cc' as unsigned long arrays.  If you can do a
	better job of converting the images or tweaking the existing ones, I'd be
  glad to include them in the distribution.

WIN2:
  The greyscale routines in win2.c were based on Wes Cherry's Win2 library
	but as with Mulg I have hacked it to draw my array images from 'pics.cc'.
	You can get the original at http://www.scumby.com/scumbysoft/pilot/win2/.
