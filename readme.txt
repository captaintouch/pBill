This is a PalmOS port of the great and addictive xBill game for the X 
Windowing System.

Welcome to pBill...

THE GAME:
	Ever  get the feeling that nothing is going right?  You're
	a sysadmin, and someone's trying to destroy  your  comput-
	ers.  The little people running around the screen are try-
	ing to infect your computers with Wingdows [TM],  a  virus
	cleverly  designed to resemble a popular operating system.
	Your objective is to click the mouse on them, ending their
	potential  threat.  If one of the people reaches a comput-
	er, it will attempt to replace your operating system  with
	the  virus it carries. It will then attempt to run off the
	screen with your vital software.  The game ends when  only
	0 or 1 of your computers is being productive.  Additional-
	ly, some computers  are  connected  with  network  cables.
	When  one  computer on a network becomes infected, a spark
	will be sent down the cable, and will infect the  computer
	on the other end when it reaches there.

	Clicking the button on one of the little people will cause
	it to cry out in pain and melt (id software eat your heart
	out!), dropping the stolen os if it is carrying one.  If a
	computer is running Wingdows or is temporarily off, the os
	can  be  dragged back to the computer (or another computer
	compatible with that os).  To extinguish a spark drag  the
	bucket of water from the upper left corner onto it.

	The status bar at the bottom tells the following:
    Number of Bills on/off the screen
 	  Number of Computers running their OS/off/Wingdows
 	  Level
	  Score

PALMOS SPECIFICS:
  If you change to another application while you are playing, when you return
	the game will start paused at the start of the level you were on with the
	score you had at the start of the level.

	Pressing the P in the top right corner will pause the game.

	Pressing the Menu key during a game will quit immediately.

	On PalmV's the default contrast looks wrong.  If you adjust the contrast
	(press the little button on the top left of the device) and slide the bar
	on the screen to sit under the 'r' of 'Contrast' it should look about right.
