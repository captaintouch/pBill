# The Game
Ever get the feeling that nothing is going right? You're a sysadmin, and someone's trying to destroy your computers. The little people running around the screen are trying to infect your computers with Wingdows [TM], a virus cleverly designed to resemble a popular operating system. Additionally, some computers are connected with network cables. When one computer on a network becomes infected, a spark will be sent down the cable, and will infect the computer on the other end when it reaches there. 

The status bar at the bottom tells the following:
- Number of Bills on/off the screen
- Number of Computers running their OS/off/Wingdows
- Level
- Score

# How to play
If you change to another application while you are playing, when you return to the game, it will start paused at the start of the level you were on with the score you had at the start of the level.
Pressing the pause icon in the top right corner will pause the game.
Pressing the Menu key during a game will end the game and drop you back into the start screen.
